/**
 * New HLS. yet another attempt at a better replacement for exp objects.
 * -get rid of idea of spans!!
 *  
 * type and filter  Customer[id > 10]        initial type and WHERE filter
 *   filter:
 *     true or pkval [15]
 *     [not] val op val
 *     [not] val like str
 *     val in [sdfsdf]
 *     cond AND/OR cond
 *     date fns
 * throughChain    .addr.country             0 or more. contiguous chain
 * field           .name                     0 or 1. query one field, not an object
 * listFn          orderBy/distinct/limit/offset/first,last,ith      sort,paging. optional    
 * fetch           fks,fetch('aaa'),...          load 0 or more sub-objects.
 * calcFn          exists,count,min,max,average,sum,...   query produces a calculated result. 
 * 
 * goals
 *  -convert filter to better objects
 *  -MEM
 *  -H2,PG using SQL 
 *    -joins caused by throughChain,fetch
 *      -implicit join: orderBy, field, and fields mentioned in filter    
 *        -only join pk if parent (in 1:1 or 1:N)
 *  -use newHLS for filters in update/upsert/delete statements
 *    
 * TODO: add delia inject attack prevention tests!
 * 
 * steps
 *  -build filtercond
 *  -build hld
 *  -fill in fieldVal.structField on all SYMBOLS that are fieldnames (they can be a let var or a fieldname. fieldname takes precedence)
 *   -actually resolve varnames to scalar values here.
 *  -build joinL and then aliases
 *  -build fieldL. affected by joins, fetch,fks,count(*), ....
 *    field should have structField.
 *    fields grouped in columnRuns (use a string groupName)
 *	public boolean isAssocField; and probably the alias name b.custId as addr
 *     -we don't want to build or construct anything during query execution. 
 *     all should be in field so that we can cache it.
 *  -should handle scalar results (count() or .firstName)
 *  -should handle select * query (lookup fields by name in rs)    
 * -now we have a high level version of the query in hld.
 * -generate sql. types of sql  
 *   -select *
 *   -count
 *   -regular
 * Development plan
 * -do Customer[true] in MEM and sql (don't actually wire up h2)
 * -do [45]
 * -do [id > 10] //leave in and like for later
 *  -do not, and do bool,int,long,number,date
 * -do order/limit stuff
 * -do .firstName scalar result
 * -do simple join, 1:1, 1:N, M:N
 * -do fetch join, then implicit joins
 * -do through join, and self-join
 * -do first,last,ith,count,...
 * 
 * -idea is a new set of unit tests that fully test MEM and sql generation
